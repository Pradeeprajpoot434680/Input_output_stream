Opening the File: The program first opens the file example.txt using FileInputStream.
Buffering the Input: It then wraps the FileInputStream with a BufferedInputStream, 
which allows the program to read larger chunks of data efficiently rather than byte by byte.
Reading Data: The while loop reads each byte from the buffer (using bis.read()), 
converts it to a character, and prints it out. The loop continues until the entire file is read.
Closing Streams: Once all data has been read, the BufferedInputStream (and the underlying FileInputStream)
 is closed to release the resources.
